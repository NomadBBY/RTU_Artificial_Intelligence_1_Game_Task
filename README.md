# Multiplication Game

This is a simple game implemented using the Pygame library. In this game, players are presented with a graphical user interface (GUI) where they can select a starting number. They then take turns multiplying the current number by either 2 or 3. The game continues until one of the players reaches a total score of 1000 or more. Each player's score is updated based on the result of their multiplication. The player with the highest score when the total reaches or exceeds 1000 is declared the winner.

## How to Play

1. Ensure you have Pygame installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
```pip install pygame```
2. Navigate to the new_game folder.
3. Run the script main.py using Python 3:
```python3 main.py```
Follow the prompts to input a number between 5 and 15.
4. Choose whether to multiply your number by 2 or 3.
5. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until a player reaches a score of 1000 or more.
6. The game will display the final scores and declare the winner.

## Classes

**GameWindow**: This class is responsible for managing all the game logic and rendering tasks. It controls the flow of the game and handles the user interface interactions, including displaying screens, accepting player inputs, updating the game state, and rendering graphical elements.

**Algorithm**: This class provides the basic algorithms used for decision-making in the game. It includes methods for making moves, updating scores, and determining possible moves.

**MinimaxAlgorithm**: This class extends the Algorithm class and implements the Minimax algorithm for decision-making in the game. It calculates the best move for the computer player by recursively exploring possible future game states and choosing the move that maximizes its score while minimizing the opponent's score.

**AlphaBetaAlgorithm**: This class extends the Algorithm class and implements the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm, an optimization of the Minimax algorithm. It improves upon Minimax by reducing the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree, thus making the decision-making process more efficient.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `pygame` module

## Example

```
# Inside the if __name__ == "__main__": block
if __name__ == "__main__":

    game = GameWindow()

    while game.running:
        game = GameWindow()
        result = game.welcome_screen()
        
        if result == "human":
            print("I am a human")
        else:
            print("I am a computer")

        result = game.choice_screen()
        print("You chose: ", result)

        # Capture the returned scores
        score1, score2 = game.game_screen(result)

        # Call winner_screen with the captured scores
        game.winner_screen(score1, score2)
```
