# Fox and Hounds Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic board game Fox and Hounds using the Pygame library.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid. The Fox player starts at the bottom center square, while the Hound players start at the top row, spaced out across the row.
   
2. **Objective**: The Fox player's goal is to reach the top row. The Hound players' goal is to trap the Fox so that it cannot move.
   
3. **Movement**: Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally to adjacent squares. The Fox player can move in any direction, while the Hound players can only move forward diagonally.

4. **Winning**: The Fox player wins if it reaches the top row. The Hound players win if they trap the Fox so that it cannot move.
